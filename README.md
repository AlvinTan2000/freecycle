## Inspiration
As our society moves to a more sustainable coexistence, we aimed to contribute by offering access to community-based, mostly free, services in the local area. Naturally, the TD Bank Group Insurance and Accenture challenges piqued our interest.
## What it does
Currently, the website runs with Australian data and it is in the process of trying to accept Canadian data. It broadcasts locations and the corresponding information for sustainable initiatives.
## How we built it
We used leaflet API in JavaScript to have a working map. For the database: we ran Apache and MySQL using XAMPP to create a local database on PhpMyAdmin. We pulled data from the database using php encoded in json. Data is written to the database using php defined by user input on the website. We also used Bootstrap and jQuery to make a functional and dynamic website. We split the project into sections related to our own interests and skills.
