## Inspiration
As our society moves to a more sustainable coexistence, we aimed to contribute by offering access to community-based, mostly free, services in the local area. Naturally, the TD Bank Group Insurance and Accenture challenges piqued our interest.
## What it does
Currently, the website runs with Australian data and it is in the process of trying to accept Canadian data. It broadcasts locations and the corresponding information for sustainable initiatives.
## How we built it
We used leaflet API in JavaScript to have a working map. For the database: we ran Apache and MySQL using XAMPP to create a local database on PhpMyAdmin. We pulled data from the database using php encoded in json. Data is written to the database using php defined by user input on the website. We also used Bootstrap and jQuery to make a functional and dynamic website. We split the project into sections related to our own interests and skills.
## Challenges we ran into
We ran into a couple of challenges, but they all brought us knowledge and growth. We were not able to bridge the backend and the frontend together, but with the help of a mentor and some research, we are proud to say that we did it. Another problem that we ran into was that our database is Australian. We had to work around that problem, and we decided to launch first an Australian site.
## Accomplishments that we are proud of
We are proud to have a running website, database and server. We are also proud to have managed to build a coherent, homogenize, eco-friendly project. We are proud of our growth and the knowledge we acquired from this challenging experience. We are proud of our small victories that built up to create this project. We are proud of using our previous knowledge and incorporate it into one beautiful website.
## What we learned
The whole project was a learning experience. We learned more about how JavaScript works and how to run a database. We also learned how to include a map API into a JavaScript code and have it running.
## What's next for freecycle.tech
We hope to expand our database to Canada and have some working geolocator in Montreal.
